# The-Ghost-Clock-Game
My first completed Unity game.

Hey, Leo here! This is a basic, small, personal project I did to keep learning and improving in my game dev journey. It is my first completed Unity project, and my first actual published game in general.

It taught me a lot, but mainly the basics of Unity 2D and how to use C# for this engine.
